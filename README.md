# Create: Simple Generator
![Icon](/src/main/resources/icon.png)

This mod just adds a simple block that converts stresses to FE.
By default, each tick consumes 1 stress (multiplied by speed) and produces 1 FE (multiplied by speed). You can modify these values through configuration.

This mod was created simply because I couldn't find any mod that can convert stress to FE in the current version. Once mods like CC&A are updated, this mod will probably stop being maintained - until the next time this happens.
