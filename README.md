# Create: Simple Generator
![Icon](/src/main/resources/icon.png)

This mod just adds a simple block that converts stresses to FE.
By default, each tick consumes 1 stress (multiplied by speed) and produces 1 FE (multiplied by speed). You can modify these values through configuration.

This mod was created simply because I couldn't find any mod that can convert stress to FE in the current version. Once mods like CC&A are updated, this mod will probably stop being maintained - until the next time this happens.

If you have installed other industrial mods that provide more efficient ways to generate Energy, I do not recommend you to use this mod. This mod is only used to help mods such as AE and RS that do not have their own efficient ways to generate Energy.
